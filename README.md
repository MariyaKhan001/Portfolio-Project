# Portfolio-Project
This is my first project as a beginner developer, and I used a template as a starting point. While the template provided the basic structure, I leveraged my growing skills to understand the core elements and customize it to fit my goals. I didnâ€™t just use the template as-is, but rather modified and enhanced it based on my knowledge of coding principles. Through this process, I gained valuable experience in applying what I've learned so far. Moving forward, I hope to create more projects from scratch, refining my skills further and exploring more complex challenges in development.
